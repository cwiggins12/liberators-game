art pipeline:
see if asset forge and mixamo are cool

to do this week:
need functions for going to and from last widget in settings and inventory (theres a widget for that, check fps sesh)
need function to set selected unit when going back to HUD from settings "					"

fuckin refactor this state machine to utilize the gameplay state tree, dummy
make game lighting ambivalent
if time permits, get path working going
get alternating state between turns in battle, 

Things to remember:
the battle level always initializes to placement state, this will need to be changed when save/load is implemented
