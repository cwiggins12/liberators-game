For today:
health bars on all units? maybe on initiative order for now?
Inventory screen, equipment system(component, 2 starting items as examples)

Before Wednesday:
Full UI rework(green/black color scheme, animate some flickers and crt waves(maybe as a shader?), wipe in from sides, add sounds on change in menu, Victory Screen update, defeat screen update, remove some buttons from main menu, remove settings menu enirely, full reward choice functionality)
Do what is needed for placement and confirm buttons

Game Mechanics:
add logic to affect max hp
fix rotate to enemy during attack
build out guard ability
basic enemy AI
Pathing on move (A*)
Enemy and Player Unit Downed logic needs a lot of work :(
Finalize logic for abilities (1v1 and self first, then maybe aoe?)

Level Mechanics:
make the project lighting agnostic
Notes on Grid Logic: need shapes and materials to utilize terrains, they are being passed, maybe roll shape and have an Enum for shapes, then do the math for each hex based on each shape or build a bool array then reference that per hex, 
make the assets for the obstacles during this week

VFX and Animation:
Selection outline needs love
Asset forge to make 3d meshes(4 for player units(per class), enemies, obstacles in the map based on terrain type, 
BP effects for take damage based on damage type
SHADERS

SFX and Music:
New battle music(long cyberpunk ambient track)
Victory screen and defeat screen quick tracks
Full rework of sounds(take damage, move, placement, attack, buff, button click, button hover, button incorrect click, hex incorrect click)

Fixes needed:
Camera isn't bounded :(
Currently not using x and y coordinates in units, may not even need them in hexes

Scrapped but will implement after class is over:
More equipment
AOE attacks
More map patterns
More Enemy types(models and AI)
Save/Load(check level bps and begin plays of core for fixes), should be minimal implementation in GameState due to all the ref arrays
Settings
Combat Log
Bring back the big ole statblock(MAKE MY ENGAGEMENT SYSTEM DAMMIT), DT, Resistance(needs status effects), 
bring back attributes and rework char creation entirely(look at design doc for the breakdown of these)
TOOLTIPS EVERYWHERE
