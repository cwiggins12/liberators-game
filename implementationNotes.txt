art pipeline:
see if asset forge is cool

For turn in:
Pathing on move (A*)
Initiative tracker
statblock component (get stats, attack, ability, move dist(?))
basic enemies
health/damage component
basic menu animations, and click sounds across the board
make the project lighting agnostic

Notes on Grid Logic: need shapes and materials to utilize terrains, they are being passed, enemy amount handled in player controller?

Things to remember:
change battle level to include save load logic when implemented

BUGS: 
1. Camera isn't bounded :(
