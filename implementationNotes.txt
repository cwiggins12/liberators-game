Game Mechanics:
Summary: Movement, Enemy AI, Abilities, Stats, death, and classes

add ability needs to get a class as input or Enum, or funcs for both
fix stat logic entirely(gonna need a temp stats for temp buffs?, get rid of those min and maxs and just clamp)
build out more abilities(at least one per class)
basic enemy AI
Pathing on move for all units(A*)
Enemy and Player Unit Downed logic
basic class system, use class Enum to specify in pc how much to give to each unit for level up

Level Mechanics:
Notes on Grid Logic: need materials to utilize terrains, they are being passed, maybe roll shape and have an Enum for shapes, build a bool array then reference that per hex, 
rewards fixes pls
enemy scaling
flavor text on the structs and opening screen(typing animation)

VFX and Animation:
Have a player turn text animation on player turn start? do the 3 in the corner after fades from noise?

Selection outline needs love
Asset forge to make 3d meshes(4 for player units(enemies will have different material), obstacles (based on terrain type)?)
mixamo for animations(idle, melee, range, self, and take damage)
BP effect for take damage
cell shader again?
simple tooltip(hexs, units, keywords in menus, and stat icons)
portraits in hud, initiative, and victory screen

SFX and Music:
New battle music(long cyberpunk ambient track)
Victory screen and defeat screen tracks
Full rework of sounds(take damage, move, placement, attack, buff, button click, button hover, button incorrect click, hex incorrect click, screen changes, etc)

Fixes needed:
Camera isn't bounded and starts in a shitty place :(
Currently not using x and y coordinates in units, may not even need them in hexes
make huds' selected player thing smaller?


Scrapped but will implement after class is over:
AOE attacks
More map patterns
More Enemy types(models and AI)
Save/Load(check level bps and begin plays of core for fixes), should be minimal implementation in GameState due to all the ref arrays
Settings Menu
Bring back the big ole statblock(engagement, DT, Resistance(needs status effects), initiative, reactivity)
bring back attributes and rework char creation entirely(look at design doc for the breakdown of these)(move to a classless system)
Combat Log
tooltips
Inventory system(equip breaks when unit goes down)
Reactivity and initiative :(

Inventory Menu look notes I had:
Background with x button in corner
follow sketch
anim placement if coming to it from not placement HUD(just a Boolean marker that gets set in placement)
Use same player info, and statblock, use ability box with all dummy buttons, 
need 2 equip widgets and an inventory widget to fit into respective areas
in and out with crt
