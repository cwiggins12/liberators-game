art pipeline:
see if asset forge is cool

For today:
animate attack, animate take damage, particles, sound,
basic menu animations, and click sounds across the board

basic enemy AI
Pathing on move (A*)
make the project lighting agnostic
Notes on Grid Logic: need shapes and materials to utilize terrains, they are being passed, maybe roll shape and have an Enum for shapes, then do the math for each hex based on each shape or build a bool array then reference that per hex, 
update statblock hud widget on SelectionChange
gonna need to allow more freedom on the placement scene, onClick switch for units needed

Things to remember:
change battle level bp begin play to include save load logic when implemented

BUGS:
1. Camera isn't bounded :(
2. FindNextUnitInInitiativeOrder is not gonna work right eventually
3. Need to rework placement logic eventually, may need separate hud to see just unit stats, inventory, and allow for changing their positions
4. Need initiative tracker
