art pipeline:
see if asset forge is cool

For today:
Units have to count actions for signal next turn, 
animate attack, animate take damage, particles, sound,
Initiative tracker :(
basic menu animations, and click sounds across the board

basic enemy AI
Pathing on move (A*)
make the project lighting agnostic
Notes on Grid Logic: need shapes and materials to utilize terrains, they are being passed, maybe roll shape and have an Enum for shapes, then do the math for each hex based on each shape or build a bool array then reference that per hex, 

Things to remember:
change battle level bp begin play to include save load logic when implemented

BUGS: 
1. Camera isn't bounded :(
