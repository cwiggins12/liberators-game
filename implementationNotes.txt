For today:
health bars on all units? maybe on initiative order for now?
REFACTOR BEFORE ADDING ANYTHING ELSE TO THIS PLS

basic enemy AI
Pathing on move (A*)
make the project lighting agnostic
Notes on Grid Logic: need shapes and materials to utilize terrains, they are being passed, maybe roll shape and have an Enum for shapes, then do the math for each hex based on each shape or build a bool array then reference that per hex, 


Things to remember:
change battle level bp begin play to include save load logic when implemented

Fixes needed:
1. Camera isn't bounded :(
2. FindNextUnitInInitiativeOrder is not gonna work right eventually
3. Need to rework placement logic eventually, may need separate hud to see just unit stats, inventory, and allow for changing their positions
4. Fill ability box and abilities in general are not scalable yet
5. Music starts in onNewGame func in GameMode
6. Rework initiative order, hex coords, and unit refs to one place when going from placement to battle
rework music player system eventually
gonna need to allow more freedom on the placement scene, onClick switch for units needed
ability buttons need to deactivate when a different one is pressed
build out oopsNevermind function in abilities
make a collider that calls a function to take place of start ability in grid logic
